I aim to create the best collection of working salt states and configs possible.\r\n\r\nThe initial goal is to have states that are compatible with both RHEL and Debian distributions. If people show interest in additional compatibility, add it as a github issue.\r\n\r\nSaltmine includes the following:\r\n\r\n### common:\r\n+ This collection is designed to be included in your salt project, and then included in your projects by including the `states` found here.\r\n\r\n### examples:\r\n+ Lots of example code and states.\r\n\r\n### systems:\r\n+ Other large builds that require state trees (such as setting up Openstack or complex db clusters) will be here.\r\n\r\n### dependencies:\r\n+ salt >= 0.12.0\r\n+ mako >= 0.7.3\r\n\r\n### installation:\r\n+ clone this repo to your salt installation, and include the directory in the file_roots setting of your salt master.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\nIf you cloned saltmine within the /srv/ directory:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nbase:\r\n  - /srv/saltmine/\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then to add a module to your salt setup, simple ``include``.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```yaml\r\ninclude:\r\n  - saltmine.common.services.git\r\n```\r\n+ Include the saltmine  \r\n\r\n### License: \r\n+ Code is licensed using Apache License 2.0\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

{"name":"SaltMine","tagline":"A curated collection of working salt states and configurations for use in your saltstack setup.","body":"The aim of this project is to create a collection of Salt states with the following characteristics:\r\n\r\n1. Easy to integrate with custom Salt setups.\r\n2. Abstracts out differences in package names to simplify package installation.\r\n3. Stable, with versioned 'releases' to guarantee compatibility as the project proceeds.\r\n4. Well-tested, with comprehensive tests built for every state. (TODO!)\r\n5. Flexible and Object-oriented, making it easy to extend and customize without modifying SaltMine code.\r\n6. Community-oriented, with external contributions quickly reviewed and integrated.\r\n7. Fun!\r\n\r\n###Contributing:\r\nSimply open a pull request on github.\r\n\r\n###Compatibility: \r\nThe initial goal is to maintain compatibility with mainstream RHEL and Debian distributions. \r\nIf people show interest in additional compatibility, please let us know by adding it as a github issue,\r\nor open pull requests with your modifications that add compatibility for your favorite repos.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies:\r\n+ salt >= 0.12.0\r\n+ mako >= 0.7.3\r\n+ python >= 2.6\r\n\r\n### Installation:\r\n+ Make sure that you have a working salt installation (including mako)\r\n+ Clone the SaltMine repo, (recommended cloning to /srv/) and include the SaltMine base directory in the file_roots setting of your salt master.\r\n+ To make the SaltMine configs available to salt minions in all environments, (recommended) add the SaltMine repo base directory to your `base` environment.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\nIf you cloned SaltMine within the /srv/ directory, this should be in your salt master config file:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nfile_roots:\r\n  base:\r\n    - /srv/saltmine/\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Using SaltMine:\r\nOnce the SaltMine repo is included into your file_roots, to use SaltMine configs in your salt setup, simply ``include`` the appropriate service or state.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```yaml\r\ninclude:\r\n  - saltmine.services.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ninclude:\r\n  - saltmine.services.haproxy\r\n```\r\n\r\n### License: \r\n+ Code is licensed using Apache License 2.0","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
